# Project Title

In the IBM Watson Studio, there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets. Users of the system interact with all of this. Within this scope, we created this recommendation system project to enhance the user experience and connect them with assets. This personalizes the experience for each user.

1. Create a fork of this repository on your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and install the project dependencies.
3. Open the Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb file within the recommendations-system folder and run to see the output of the codes.

## File Structure

### Dependencies
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib
5. pickle


## Testing

Tests are embedded within the jupyter notebook file and are run intermittently to check code functionalities for all recommendation systems method.

The project_tests.py file in the recommendation systems folder contains all written tests
